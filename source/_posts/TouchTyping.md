Happy Sunday!

# 92 keys
Since I bought a new mechanical keyboard last week I have been ecstatic about it. I have chosen cheap Rapoo VPRO V500 with black switches. I opted for tenkeyless layout to save some space. I am used to use number row, the missing number pad is not an issue for me. There actually weren't many options since I dislike rainbow backlight and gaming appearance.

Once the keyboard arrived I have realized it was a high time to hone my touch typing skills. I sifted through many training apps and eventually came across the [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/). Their typing course has visually pleasing UI with funny little typing games. I have been practicing the touch typing there for three evenings and it has helped me a lot.

# Together for Falcon 9 
Yesterday's Falcon manned launch was an unforgettable moment not only due to that achievement itself. An whole family, three generations (and two dachshunds) were watching the launch together - finally reunited after two months of separation caused by the COVID quarantine. It was a heartwarming moment.
