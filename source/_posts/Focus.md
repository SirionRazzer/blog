I have tried to design a nonobtrusive timer app named Focus, [check it out](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.soczilla.focus). I don't intend to continue its development since there is no need for another Pomodoro app. The main (and only) specialty of the Focus is a text field used to specify a current goal.
